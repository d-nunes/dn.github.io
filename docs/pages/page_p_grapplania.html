                    This was a solo project I made in the Unity engine over the course of my final semester of DigiPen. Back in
                    sophomore year, I formed a team to see if we could make a 2D platformer in the style of the classic
                    Castlevania series; more specifically, Super Castlevania IV. That particular title made use of a
                    grappling mechanic, but our instructors were strongly against emulating something so complex. So,
                    <i>this</i> project was my chance to make what I wanted back in sophomore year a reality.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I didn't end up making a full-on Castlevania clone, but I managed to create the swinging mechanic and a
                    decently challenging experience around it.

                    <u><b>The Swinging Mechanic</b></u><br/><br/>
                    With this being made in Unity, one would expect physics-based movement to be taken care of
                    by the built-in physics. While I did use it for standard movement like running and jumping,
                    the swinging was completely custom-made. I felt creating it from scratch would allow me to
                    truly understand what's happening under the hood and allow for easy tweaking of values to
                    perfect the feel of the swing.<br/><br>

                    Being the core mechanic of the game, it was the first thing I started working on. To the right
                    of this text, you'll see a less graphically-rich gameplay clip. This is showcasing what I had
                    done on the first week of development.

                    <u><b>The Camera</b></u><br/><br/>
                    Easily one of the most time-consuming things I worked on for this project. Of course, Unity comes
                    with its own camera, but how it behaves must be made from scratch. The use of a Unity interpolation
                    function makes smoothly following the player easy enough to implement. However, the creation of camera
                    boundaries is much less trivial. Camera boundaries are a staple of 2D games. The camera will stay
                    centered on the player much of the time, but once they walk to close to a wall, the camera will cease
                    following horizontally. While not necessarily mandatory behavior, I felt it was needed for game feel.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I originally intended to create a sort of concave polygon that spanned a level and contained the camera,
                    but it unfortunately did not work (as it got very confused at corners). I quickly pivoted and found a
                    solution that was not only easier to implement, but virtually functioned the same.<br/>
                    Instead of a single bounding shape, I made individual boxes that could intersect to simulate
                    a larger, concave polygon. If the player entered an appropriate area, the camera would leave whatever
                    bounding box it was previously in and smoothly transition to the next one.<br/><br/>
                    Many hours were spent fixing bugs, and there were still a few tiny quirks with the camera behavior
                    after publishing the game, but it functioned well enough.

                    <u><b>The Audio</b></u><br/><br/>
                    Unity supports middleware like FMOD and Wwise, which I had to work with in the past, but instead of relearning
                    them for a small project, I just decided to work with Unity's audio engine and make my own sort of audio object
                    to interface with it.<br/><br/>
                    There was the simple play-sound-effect-when-a-particular-event-happens, but I also implemented
                    fading for music tracks (including crossfading), seamless looping for audio files that can't be repeated easily
                    (i.e. replaying the audio from a particular point in the file rather than just the beginning), as well as a system
                    that prevents a given sound effect from playing too soon after it's already been played.<br/><br/>
                    It may not sound like much, especially since it utilized Unity's audio engine, but I believe this interface turned
                    into a fairly intuitive system that any designer/programmer could work with (i.e. a simple "I'd like to do this.
                    Oh, there's a function for it!" and it works fine with the user not needing to know how it works under the hood;
                    a black box, essentially.)

                    <u><b>The Level Design</b></u><br/><br/>
                    While not a coding task, I felt<code>&#8212;</code>since I was in the "Computer Science <i>and</i>
                    Game Design" program at DigiPen<code>&#8212;</code>mentioning the level design here was warranted.
                    Creating a mechanic for a game is one thing, but bringing out its potential is another. Level design
                    fills this very role (especially for a movement-based mechanic).<br/><br/>
                    I spent quite a bit of time drawing out the levels and individual obstacles within them. Then there was
                    translating it to the actual game and having it playtested. Much polishing and iterating ocurred after
                    receiving feedback, and I believe the end result did a good job accentuating the core mechanic, as well
                    as gradually introducing more challenge as the player progressed.
