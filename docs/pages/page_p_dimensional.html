                Dimensional Gears is a 2.5D puzzle platformer that takes place in a dystopian steam-punk future
                where household appliances are the only sentient beings left. You play as Mike O. Wave the lovable
                microwave. You and your friends are stuck in an abandoned factory and must use Mike's supernatural
                ability to shift dimensions in order to escape. Make the most of this strange power to explore a
                dangerous 2.5D environment within a shifting, orthographic plane to escape the factory and save
                your friends.

                    This was a solo project I made in the Unity engine over the course of my final semester of DigiPen. Back in
                    sophomore year, I formed a team to see if we could make a 2D platformer in the style of the classic
                    Castlevania series; more specifically, Super Castlevania IV. That particular title made use of a
                    grappling mechanic, but our instructors were strongly against emulating something so complex. So,
                    <i>this</i> project was my chance to make want I wanted back in sophomore year a reality.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I didn't end up making a full-on Castlevania clone, but I managed to create the swinging mechanic and a
                    decently challenging experience around it.

                    <u><b>The Audio Implementation</b></u><br/><br/>
                    Junior year of DigiPen requires students use the industry-standard audio middleware Wwise in their
                    game projects. I stuck with my team from sophomore year, and since I was the audio programmer then,
                    I remained the audio programmer for this project. With the sound designer working on his audio within
                    Wwise's interface and my integration of it into Unity, we were able to:<br/><br/>
                    - Get smooth transitions between music tracks.<br/>
                    - Implement adaptive music.<br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Music became more intense if the player were low on health.<br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- If the player were behind a wall, which prevented movement, music was muffled.<br/>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- When paused, music was more mellow.<br/>
                    - Add spatial audio.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The spatial audio is notable due to the style of the game. While it is 2D in nature, it is housed within a 3D
                    space.<br/>
                    Say an object producing sound were next to the player. From an orthographic view, it will always seem this way.
                    However, from a perspective view, it could actually be some ways behind or in front of the player. If we simply
                    add a sound effect to this object, get the distance between it and the player for the spatial audio effect, we
                    would merely get spatial audio in 3D. However, because the game is technically 2D, we need 2D spatial audio.<br/> 
                    The solution I implemented for this had every "spatial audio" object be given a child object that contained their
                    respective sounds. Depending on which plane the player was viewing the game in, I would project all spatial sound
                    child objects onto the plane. Because the tech lead on the team did something similar for the player character, it
                    meant now all spatial sounds and the player were on the same plane. This emulated 2D spatial audio perfectly, as
                    the 3rd dimension had essentially been stripped from the appropriate objects.

                    <u><b>Backup</b></u><br/><br/>
                    Because we were working in Unity, our many designers<code>&#8212;</code>who were well-versed
                    in the engine<code>&#8212;</code>were capable of implementing certain things the programmers
                    likely would have done, meaning the tech team had less tasks to work on. I was the audio programmer,
                    and that was really all I was given to do. However, I essentially served as backup in the event new
                    tasks were created and the rest of the programmers already had their hands full. Tasks I took included
                    (but were not limited to):<br/><br/>
                    - Making the originally static jump variable.<br/>
                    - Shrinking assets the player was able to pick up.<br/>
                    - Recreating the behavior of the one enemy type we had in the game.<br/>
                    - Displaying button prompts over interactable elements.<br/>
                    - Connecting pushable buttons to spawners so they actually functioned.<br/>
                    - Many general bug fixes we had listed on a spreadsheet that other members were assigned, but weren't
                      able to get to at the time.<br/>
