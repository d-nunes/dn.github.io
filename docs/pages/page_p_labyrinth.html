                    The precursor to Grapplania. Sophomore year of DigiPen has students form teams to create a custom engine with C++.
                    When I formed the team, I suggested we make a simple 2D platformer in the style of Castlevania, and center it
                    around a grapple mechanic (like the one from Super Castlevania IV). Instructors believed our concept was
                    out-of-scope, so we had to pivot to a simplified "swing" and make the game's challenge solely platforming
                    (no enemies, no health system, etc.).<br/><br/>
                    We may not have created what we originally sought to develop, but it was a great learning experience.

                    <u><b>Engine Work</b></u><br/><br/>
                    Before we could start work on an actual game, us programmers were responsible for creating a custom engine
                    to actually host a gameplay experience.<br/><br/>
                    I created that underlying loop that calls every function (draw, update, input, etc) as well as calculates
                    delta time.<br/><br/>
                    I made a game state manager in the form of a stack. You'd push states onto the stack, and whatever was on
                    top would be the current state (with everything below being suspended). Popping the current state off
                    would resume the state below it. This functionality ended up underutilized, as there wasn't much need to
                    suspend states over others. It was ultimately only used for the pause menu. If you were in the "Level 1"
                    state and paused, a "Pause" state would be pushed onto the stack and suspend level 1. Unpausing would pop
                    the pause state off the stack and resume level 1.<br/>
                    When it came to transitioning from level to level, I just used a function that replaced the topmost
                    state in the stack with another.<br/>
                    Any information that needed to persist across game states (audio, play time, score, etc.) was stored within
                    a pointer that just existed outside of the scope of the states.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I added an animation system to the engine. It was based off a method us CS students had been shown in a previous
                    course. However, that implementation simply took sprite sheets and played through them start to finish. If
                    you needed multiple animations, you had to separate them into different files. I was not a fan of such a
                    restriction. I was used to sprite sheets containing all frames of a particular entity. If we have a player sprite,
                    we should have a single sprite sheet that contains the frames for idling, running, jumping, and every other
                    action. With this sentiment, I altered the animation implementation I was taught to include indexing within
                    sprite sheets. That way you could iterate through a series of sprites within a sheet rather than the whole
                    file.<br/><br/>
                    Being the audio programmer on the team, I was responsible for implementing the audio engine. For sophomore year,
                    we needed to use the audio middleware FMOD. I made the pipeline as streamlined as I possibly could at the time.
                    If our Sound Designer ever needed to add a new sound effect or music track to the game, they were only required
                    to add the name of the audio file to a list in a text file, and the audio engine would do the rest of the work.
                    Of course, there still needed to be a line of code somewhere to actually play the sound/music at the right time,
                    and placing said line was my responsibility.

                    <u><b>Gameplay-related Programming</b></u><br/><br/>
                    Eventually, the back-end work of our custom engine was pretty much done, so programmers could start
                    focusing on assisting designers in translating their work and fleshing out certain pipelines for them.<br/>
                    I was responsible for transferring the game's core mechanic to our engine, which had been created in
                    Unity by the designers. It may not sound like much, but it was a good learning experience. I had to analyze
                    C# and translate it accordingly to C++, as well as optimize it.<br/><br/>
                    In the prototype levels the designers made, they depicted grappling points that moved along paths. I
                    ended up creating a path system in the custom engine that could be given a series of points, and a given
                    object would interpolate across them.
                    <br/><br/>
                    During development, designers asked if moving platforms could be made. The responsibility of creating the
                    behavior and collision fell on me. The tech lead, who had created the static collision for the game's
                    levels, said his collision wasn't capable of physics-based movement, so I had to essentially create a
                    smaller collision system from scratch for moving platforms (using the AABB collision method). Combined
                    with the path system I made, moving platforms functioned well.<br/>
                    The only gripe I had with my implementation was the fact that standing on moving platforms resulted in a
                    minor vertical jitter, which was due to gravity trying to push the player into the platform, and my collision
                    code pushing it out. While it was disappointing, designers did note playtesters liked the effect, as the
                    jitter seemed like a natural result of standing on a moving, machine-like platform. So, in the end, that
                    bug stayed in as a feature.
